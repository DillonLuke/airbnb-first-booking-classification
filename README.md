# Airbnb New User First Booking Classification
First-time Airbnb users can book a stay in over 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. To provide more personalized user recommendations, it is import to forecast the destination a user might choose for their first booking. In response to a [Kaggle challenge hosted by Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings), the purpose of this project is to classify the destination country of a user's first booking. Destinations include 10 possible countries spanning across North America, Europe, and Australia, some other country beyond these, or no booking at all.

The primary machine learning workflow can be seen in **"Airbnb New User First Booking Classification.ipynb."** This workflow relies on custom classes and functions found in **"custom_sklearn_transformers.py"** and **"airbnb_classification_functions.py"**, respectively. This workflow also relies on features engineered from user session logs, the workflow for which can be seen in **"Session Log Feature Engineering.ipynb."**
